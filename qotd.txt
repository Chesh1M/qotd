Professional athletes are in many ways our culture's holy men. They give themselves over to a pursuit to endure great privation and pain to actualize themselves at it, and enjoy a relationship to perfection that we admire, reward and love to watch, even though we have no desire to walk that road ourselves. In other words, they do it 'for' us, sacrifice themselves for our (we imagine) redemption

The 4 noble truths
1. Dukkha (suffering): life is a struggle filled with anguish.
2. Sumaday (cause): Buddha taught his followers that "sumaday" refered to desire, and that dukkha was because of human beings greed and selfishness.
3. Nirodha (it can be ceased): we can stop dukkha if we learn how to deal with sumaday. We cannot change what life throws us but we can control our responses.
4. Marga (path): a means to enlightenment, the 8 fold path of buddhism
- The Buddha

冰冻三尺非一日之寒，滴水石穿非一日之功。Most snowflakes fall harmlessly and silently. A snowflake can cause an avalanche. But of course not every snowflake does, except that they make the ultimate avalanche worse because they’re building up the snowpack. And when one of them hits the wrong way, it could spin out of control. The way to think about it is that the triggering snowflake might not look much different from the harmless snowflake that preceded it. It’s just that it hit the system at the wrong time, at the wrong place. You can’t tell in advance which snowflake will trigger the avalanche. It only becomes obvious afterwards.
